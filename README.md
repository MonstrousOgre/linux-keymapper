# linux-keymapper

A tool that lets you remap a keyboard/keypad on Linux, written in Rust

Since this uses [evdev](https://www.freedesktop.wiki/Software/libevdev/) (which sits lower on the stack than X, Wayland, or even the tty), it should work in any environment.

**Disclaimer**

The reason there hasn't been a commit for months is that I don't have the time to work on this. I decided against archiving this repo for now, but I can't give an estimate on when it'll be completed. Meanwhile, there's a [better alternative](https://github.com/sezanzeb/key-mapper).
